Jake Simon is an Associate Professor in the <a href='https://www.physastro.iastate.edu/' target='_blank'>Department of Physics & Astronomy</a> at <a href='https://www.iastate.edu/' target='_blank'>Iowa State University</a>.
He is an expert in computational astrophysics and uses high fidelity simulations and direct comparisons between the output of these simulations and observations to understand the various stages of [planet formation](/research/planet-formation/).
He is particularly interested in [magnetically driven](/research/fluid-dynamics/#magnetohydrodynamics) [accretion processes](/research/protoplanetary-disks/#accretion) and turbulence in young, [planet-forming disks](/research/protoplanetary-disks/), as well as the formation of ~1-100 km sized objects, known as [planetesimals](/research/planet-formation/#planetesimal-formation) (e.g., asteroids, comets).
