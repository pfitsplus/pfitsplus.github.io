# 3rd PFITS+ Meeting on Hydrodynamics of Circumstellar Disks and Planet Formation
{% include figure image_path='/assets/images/research/meetings/goldengate.png' %}
## <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> 2026 June 8--12

The goal of the meeting is to bring together researchers to discuss current and future research on planet formation with a focus on hydrodynamical instabilities and computational astrophysics. Topics to be covered:
- Vertical shear instability
- Convective overstability
- Rossby wave instability
- Streaming instabilities
- Non-ideal MHD instabilities

The workshop is the third in the [PFITS+](/) (Planet Formation in the Southwest Plus) series:
the [first meeting](https://www.ufos-project.eu/dust-gas-drag-instability-code-comparison) was held in June, 2022, in Las Cruces, NM;
the [second](https://sites.google.com/view/tcanaz) in Tucson AZ, in Nov., 2023.

All participants are kindly asked to register by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyDIlCAMdTOTdDBOZz1sXVF8MqAswBGJHpOcJv2G8gO1kCSw/viewform){:target="_blank"} ([RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyDIlCAMdTOTdDBOZz1sXVF8MqAswBGJHpOcJv2G8gO1kCSw/viewform){:target="_blank"}).
The meeting will include invited and contributed talks to be announced here. Due to space constraints, the meeting will be capped at 50 participants. A zoom component will be available for remote participants beyond this limit or who cannot make the trip.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-landmark"></i> Venue
[SETI institute](https://www.seti.org/), Mountain View, CA.

Mountain View is located in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, approximately 10 miles north of San Jose and 35 miles south of San Francisco. The closest airport is San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC), about a 15–20 minute drive from the venue. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Oakland International Airport (OAK) are additional options, each roughly 45–60 minutes away depending on traffic. While limited regional rail (Caltrain) and light rail services are available, public transportation within Mountain View and between airports and hotels can be sparse and time-consuming. We therefore recommend renting a car or planning to use rideshare services for convenience.
