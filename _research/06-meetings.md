# 3rd PFITS+ Meeting on Hydrodynamics of Circumstellar Disks and Planet Formation
{% include figure image_path='/assets/images/research/meetings/goldengate.png' %}
## 2026 June 8--12

The goal of the meeting is to bring together researchers to discuss current and future research on planet formation with a focus on hydrodynamical instabilities and computational astrophysics. Topics to be covered:
- vertical shear instability
- convective overstability
- Rossby wave instability
- streaming instabilities
- other instabilities

The workshop is the third in the [PFITS+](/) (Planet Formation in the Southwest Plus) series:
the [first meeting](https://www.ufos-project.eu/dust-gas-drag-instability-code-comparison) was held in June, 2022, in Las Cruces, NM;
the [second](https://sites.google.com/view/tcanaz) in Tucson AZ, in Nov., 2023.

All participants are kindly asked to register by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyDIlCAMdTOTdDBOZz1sXVF8MqAswBGJHpOcJv2G8gO1kCSw/viewform){:target="_blank"} ([RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyDIlCAMdTOTdDBOZz1sXVF8MqAswBGJHpOcJv2G8gO1kCSw/viewform){:target="_blank"}).
